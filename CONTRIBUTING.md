# Contributing Guide

Please read this guide before creating a pull request, otherwise your contribution might not be approved.

## Branch Organization

All pull request branches are created from `main`.

We use the following structure for branch names:

\<type\>/\<short-description\>

Possible types are:

- feature
- enhancement
- bugfix
- hotfix

The pull request template will provide additional information on the requirement for the integration of changes into the DeltaBot.  
Once the changes in your pull request are approved, they can be merged into `main`.


**That's it for now. Feel free to contribute to the project :heart:**
